# Adaboost Visualizer
The aim of this project is to make a research or learning tool for researchers who want to visualize **ensemble learning method- Adaboost (Adaptive Boosting)**. It will implement AdaBoost in  multidimensional dataset, showing instance weight changes. For ease of visualization, it will use a dimensionality reduction technique. It is important for users to view step by step weight change for the classifier and the dataset. This is what motivated me for taking the initiative to make a research tool.

My final product will be a fully functional website where user will give training data with attributes and corresponding output class to the application. Then it will perform a dimensionality reduction technique (principal component analysis) on the n-dimension data. After that, it will perform Adaboost on the training data showing the user step by step weight changes of the dataset. It will also show corresponding graphical representation of decision tree and graph plotting data set. User can also fill up questionnaire and system will provide him/her with learning curve or rate from those who used this website. It will also provide user with guideline for proper understanding of website. I have plan to extend this website in future implementing visualization of more machine learning algorithm  for better understanding of these algorithm.
