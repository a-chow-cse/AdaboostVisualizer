# Adaboost Visualizer
The aim of this project is to make a research or learning tool for researchers who want to visualize **ensemble learning method- Adaboost (Adaptive Boosting)**. It will implement AdaBoost in  multidimensional dataset, showing instance weight changes. For ease of visualization, it will use a dimensionality reduction technique. It is important for users to view step by step weight change for the classifier and the dataset. This is what motivated me for taking the initiative to make a research tool.

**Normal Requirements**
Normal requirements consist of objectives and goals that are stated during the meeting with the clients. Normal requirements of the project are:
-Working with user provided multidimensional datasets
-Using one-hot encoding for categorical attributes
-Using principal component analysis (PCA) in dimensionality reduction module
-Visualizing instances/samples in two dimension graph with different colors for different classes
-Performing Adaboost on the training data showing the user step by step weight changes of the dataset
-Showing corresponding graphical representation of decision tree
-Highlighting the sub dataset that is currently being used to train the classifier
-Having feature to proceed and undo the process to find the optimal weighted classifiers
-Comparing results from test data and showing prediction accuracy

**Expected Requirements**
These requirements are implicit to the system and may be so fundamental that the customer does not explicitly state those. Expected requirements of the project are:
-Providing a user friendly interface for the users
-Accurate analysis algorithm and techniques
-Efficient and fast data processing

**Exciting Requirements**
These requirements are for features that go beyond the customerâ€™s expectation and prove to be very satisfying when present. Exciting requirements of the project are:
-Having different preprocessing techniques
-Showing attribute information - unique, distinct, maximum value, minimum value, class percentage
-Providing learning curve
